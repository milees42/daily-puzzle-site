      "question": "Five people are wearing hats that are either red or blue. They are standing in a line and can only see the hats of those in front of them. Each person must say out loud what color hat theyâ€™re wearing. They can't see their own hat. What strategy guarantees that at least 4 of them guess correctly?",
      "answer": "The first person counts the number of red hats ahead and says 'red' if it's even, 'blue' if it's odd. Each person after can determine their own hat color based on that and the colors they've heard. This allows at least 4 to guess correctly."
